## 5E1

(4) would be the standard way to write a multiple linear regression. I Suppose (2) could be valid? If we force the intercept to be 0. (3) seems plausible, but from the lack of an index on beta I would think you're forcing the beta for x to be equal to -1 * the beta for z, which is.. strange?

Van Bussel agrees https://github.com/castels/StatisticalRethinking/blob/master/Chapter%205/VanBussel_Chapter5_Questions.pdf



## 5E2

mu_latitude_i = alpha + beta_adiv * adiv_i + beta_pdiv * pdiv_i

## 5E3

$$time_i \sim \text{Normal(} \mu, \sigma) $$
$$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_f f_i + \beta_s s_i $$
Both slope parameters should be positive. 

Van Bussel agrees!

But I still can make a stupid latex document. One day. 

## 5E4

1, 3, 4 would be my guesses.

Van Bussel disagrees - 4 is not correct. But I still think it works?
